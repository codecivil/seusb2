Description: Authorize USB input devices
 The package enforces authorization of USB input devices. Newly connected 
 devices are disabled and a popup dialogue allows any member of the group
 seusb2 to permanently allow or deny access to the device. The dialogue
 states type and model of the device. In this way, rogue USB devices acting
 as keyboards can be banned effectively.
